    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>

    <p>
        In this unit, I want to learn how to build interactive and visually appealing websites.<br>
        I am also excited to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another goal is to gain confidence in web development so I can design personal projects and professional webpages in the future.

        Special characters are useful in HTML. For example, you can write: &amp;, &lt;, and &gt;.
